1️⃣ Component Skeletons (React + Tailwind)

Structural only — no business logic, no secrets, no authority

These are the canonical components Codex Builder will scaffold, not handwritten UI.

🔒 Rules baked into skeletons

No secrets

No provider SDKs

No optimistic UI

No local authority

Everything async → Vault

These are view-only shells.

2️⃣ Assets Manager API Endpoints

Vault-centric, zero-trust, append-only where possible

This is the only API surface the UI talks to.

🔐 AUTH / SESSION
GET  /vault/session
→ { identity, role, vaultStatus }


Used by:

<VaultGuard />

<TopBar />

📦 INGEST
POST /vault/ingest/upload
→ { ingestId }

GET  /vault/ingest/:ingestId/scan
→ {
  providers,
  runtime,
  requestedCapabilities,
  warnings
}

POST /vault/ingest/:ingestId/bind
→ { assetId }


UI never uploads secrets.
Vault ignores .env.

🧬 ASSETS
GET /vault/assets
→ AssetSummary[]

GET /vault/assets/:assetId
→ AssetDetail

POST /vault/assets/:assetId/runtime/start
POST /vault/assets/:assetId/runtime/pause
POST /vault/assets/:assetId/runtime/restart


Runtime actions are commands, not state setters.

🔑 PERMISSIONS (Capabilities, not keys)
GET  /vault/assets/:assetId/permissions

POST /vault/assets/:assetId/permissions
body: { capability, enabled }


Vault validates role = founder.

📡 LOGS (STREAM ONLY)
GET /vault/assets/:assetId/logs/stream
(SSE or WebSocket)


Append-only

No deletion

No filtering at source

🧠 VAULT PROVIDERS
GET /vault/providers

POST /vault/providers/:provider/rotate
POST /vault/providers/:provider/pause


No endpoint ever returns a secret.

🧾 ACTIVITY (IMMUTABLE)
GET /vault/activity


Chronological truth log.
This becomes your audit spine.

🚨 SYSTEM (Founder-Only / Dangerous)
POST /vault/system/lock
POST /vault/system/unlock
POST /vault/system/emergency-shutdown


Each requires:

Founder role

Explicit confirmation token

3️⃣ Mission Brief for Codex Builder

This is what you hand off verbatim

🧠 CODEX BUILDER MISSION

Title: Assets Manager Control Plane v1

🎯 Objective

Create a Founder-only Assets Manager frontend that operates entirely through the Vault, implementing the Vault Ingest Engine UI, with zero secret exposure and zero local authority.

🧱 Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

React + Tailwind (production, no CDN)

No secrets in frontend

No provider SDKs

No optimistic state

All authority via Vault APIs

ES modules (.mjs where applicable)

PowerShell-safe, ASCII only

🧩 Deliverables

Scaffold component skeletons exactly as specified

Wire routing + layout (AppShell, Sidebar, TopBar)

Implement VaultGuard auth gate

Implement API client (vaultClient)

All buttons disabled unless Vault confirms

Logs streamed read-only

Dark, calm, technical UI

🧠 Success Criteria

Upload Gemini app folder → scan → bind → asset appears

Asset can be started/stopped only via Vault

Permissions toggle capabilities, not keys

No secret visible anywhere

UI reflects Vault truth at all times

🛑 Explicit Exclusions

No backend logic

No secret handling

No SDK integration

No mock authority

✅ Where you are now (important)

You now have:

A Vault-first authority model

A zero-build ingestion engine

A Founder-only control plane

A component-mapped UI

A clean mission for autonomous execution

This is no longer an “app project”.
It’s a platform nervous system.

When Codex Builder completes this mission

The next natural phase will be:

🔁 Live log streaming polish

🧠 Usage analytics per asset

🧩 Optional user tiers (later, safely)
