# VOICE POLICY — CODEX v1.0 (STABLE)

## Purpose
This document governs all voice and audio behaviour across Codex v1 systems.

## Default State
- Voice is OFF by default
- No automatic speech
- No speech on hover alone

## Allowed Triggers
- Clicking a speaker icon
- Clicking a Read or Explain button

## Forbidden Behaviour
- No audio on page load
- No background listening
- No microphone access without consent
- No recording or storage of voice data

## Speaker Modes
- Read Card (verbatim)
- Explain Card (AI explanation)

## AI Explanation Rules
AI must explain:
1. What the tool is
2. What it does
3. Why it is useful
4. Why AI suggested it (if applicable)
5. Whether it is optional or required

## Tone
- Calm
- Educational
- Neutral
- Non-authoritative

## Micro-Rules
- **Voice Length Cap**: Explain mode is limited to 20–30 seconds. Read mode is verbatim only.
- **Exit Feedback**: Speaker icons must visually fade or pulse out when speech finishes.

## User Control
The user is always in control.  
Speech must stop immediately when disabled.

**Governance Lock**: The Codex Autonomous Orchestrator assists decision-making but never removes user control.

**v1 Release Lock**: This release (v1.0) is feature-locked. Future enhancements will not alter core behavior.

Status: Enforced across all Codex v1 systems.
