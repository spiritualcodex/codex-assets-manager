Tactical Manager – Simulation & UI Contract

Scope: Football simulation UI + engine integration
Non-scope: Office shell, diagnostics UI

1. Tactical Manager – Purpose

Tactical Manager is a deterministic football simulation system.

It supports:

Match simulation

League tables

Season progression

Career advancement

Timeline & hierarchy views

It is engine-driven, not UI-driven.

2. Core Architecture (Locked)

Rules

❌ No database

❌ No Gemini / LLM

❌ No UI-side computation

✅ Engine is authoritative

✅ UI consumes contracts only

3. Simulation Engine (Authoritative)
Location
simulation-engine/

Responsibilities

Match simulation

Season execution

Event emission

League table calculation

Timeline generation

5. Data Contracts (Locked)

Defined in:

src/types/contracts.ts


Mocks available in:

src/mocks/data/


Includes:

LeagueTable

SeasonSnapshot

SeasonSave

SeasonTimeline

LeagueHierarchyGraph

These shapes are authoritative for the UI.

6. Match Flow (End-to-End)

UI triggers match intent

Backend forwards to engine

Engine simulates match

Engine updates league state

Engine emits result

UI re-renders:

Match result

League table

Timeline / summary

UI never calculates standings.

7. What Tactical Manager Is NOT

❌ CRUD app

❌ Form-driven system

❌ Persistent datastore

❌ UI-heavy logic

It is a simulation pipeline.

8. Current Focus

While DB-backed leagues are built later:

React UI wiring continues

League refresh loop finalised

Harness validates behaviour

Engine remains untouched

9. Tactical Mental Model

Engine = Referee + physics

Tactical Manager UI = Scoreboards

Codex Office = Manager’s box

10. Status

✅ Engine complete
✅ UI screens complete
✅ Contracts stable
🔄 Final UI ↔ engine loop polish
