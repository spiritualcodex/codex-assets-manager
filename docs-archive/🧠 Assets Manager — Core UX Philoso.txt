🧠 Assets Manager — Core UX Philosophy

One rule:

If it doesn’t go through the Vault, it doesn’t exist.

So the UI never edits apps, never shows secrets, never executes directly.
It observes, authorizes, and commands.

🧱 High-Level Layout (Mental Model)
4
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Top Bar (Status + Vault) │
├──────────┬───────────────┤
│ Sidebar  │ Main Panel    │
│ (Assets) │ (Contextual)  │
└──────────┴───────────────┘


Dark, calm, technical.
No consumer fluff. This is a cockpit.

1️⃣ Top Bar — System Truth

Always visible. Never hidden.

Elements

🟢 Vault Status: SECURE / DEGRADED / LOCKED

🔐 Auth Identity: Founder

🧠 Active Runtime Count

📡 Live Event Pulse (subtle)

Why

You should feel the system breathing.

2️⃣ Sidebar — Asset-First Navigation
Sections
▸ Assets
▸ Ingest
▸ Vault
▸ Activity
▸ System


Each section maps 1-to-1 with Vault capabilities.

No feature sprawl.

3️⃣ Ingest Screen — “Absorb an App”

This is where the magic happens.

UI Flow

Upload Folder / Zip

Review detected intent

Detected:
✓ Gemini AI usage
✓ Hybrid runtime
✓ 3 entry points
✓ No hardcoded secrets

Requested capabilities:

No build.
No warnings unless critical.
Vault stays in control.

4️⃣ Assets List — Managed Reality

This is your living Codex.

Asset Card
[ APP NAME ]
Status: Managed
Runtime: Hybrid
AI: Gemini
Permissions: 1
Last Event: 12s ago

Actions (Founder-Only)

▶ Start

⏸ Pause

🔒 Lock

📡 View Logs

⚙ Permissions

No delete button by default.
Destruction should be intentional.

5️⃣ Asset Detail View — Control Without Touching
Tabs
Overview | Permissions | Runtime | Logs | Health

Overview

Asset hash (immutable)

Runtime type

Ingest timestamp

Linked providers

Permissions

Toggle capabilities, not keys:

[✓] ai.gemini.inference
[ ] ai.image.generate
[ ] ai.voice.tts

Runtime

Start / stop shell

Restart safely

Inject config (via Vault only)

6️⃣ Vault Screen — Secrets Without Exposure

This screen never shows keys.

Shows

Providers registered

Apps using each provider

Usage metrics

Rotation status

Example:

Gemini API
Used by: 4 assets
Status: Healthy
Rotation: 14 days ago


Buttons:

Rotate

Pause provider

Revoke per app

7️⃣ Activity Stream — Immutable Truth

Chronological, append-only:

[12:44] Asset X requested ai.gemini.inference → APPROVED
[12:43] Asset Y shell started
[12:41] Gemini key rotated


This becomes:

Audit trail

Debug tool

Proof of control

8️⃣ System Screen — The Kill Switch Layer

Founder-only, dangerous by design.

Controls

Lock all assets

Pause Vault outbound traffic

Disable provider globally

Emergency shutdown

This is your “Most High” panel.
Minimal. Deliberate. Hard to misclick.

🧬 Why This UI Works With the Ingest Engine

Ingest Engine handles understanding

Vault handles authority

Assets Manager handles decision

Each layer does one job.

No overlap. No leakage.

🎯 What this UI Enables Immediately

One-click Gemini app onboarding

Infinite scaling without chaos

Zero secret exposure

Founder-only sovereignty

SaaS-ready later (roles already implied)
