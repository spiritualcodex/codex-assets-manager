🧠 CODEX BUILDER MISSION

Title: Assets Manager Control Plane v1

🎯 Objective

Create a Founder-only Assets Manager frontend that operates entirely through the Vault, implementing the Vault Ingest Engine UI, with zero secret exposure and zero local authority.

🧱 Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

React + Tailwind (production, no CDN)

No secrets in frontend

No provider SDKs

No optimistic state

All authority via Vault APIs

ES modules (.mjs where applicable)

PowerShell-safe, ASCII only

🧩 Deliverables

Scaffold component skeletons exactly as specified

Wire routing + layout (AppShell, Sidebar, TopBar)

Implement VaultGuard auth gate

Implement API client (vaultClient)

All buttons disabled unless Vault confirms

Logs streamed read-only

Dark, calm, technical UI

🧠 Success Criteria

Upload Gemini app folder → scan → bind → asset appears

Asset can be started/stopped only via Vault

Permissions toggle capabilities, not keys

No secret visible anywhere

UI reflects Vault truth at all times

🛑 Explicit Exclusions

No backend logic

No secret handling

No SDK integration

No mock authority

✅ Where you are now (important)

You now have:

A Vault-first authority model

A zero-build ingestion engine

A Founder-only control plane

A component-mapped UI

A clean mission for autonomous execution

This is no longer an “app project”.
It’s a platform nervous system.

When Codex Builder completes this mission

The next natural phase will be:

🔁 Live log streaming polish

🧠 Usage analytics per asset

🧩 Optional user tiers (later, safely)

When you’re ready, just say:
